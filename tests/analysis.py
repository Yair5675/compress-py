# TODO:
#  [ ] - Create some class that collects input size, compressed size, time it took to compress, memory usage data over
#        time, compression ratio and space saving
#  [ ] - Plot compression ratio relative to input size, color algorithms differently to make it more visually appealing
#  [ ] - Plot memory usage of all algorithms in a single plot to compare them. since multiple files are compressed with
#        the same algorithm, calculate the average memory usage graph for the same algorithm on multiple files and plot
#        this
#  [ ] - Rank algorithms for each corpora
#  [ ] - Save results to a CSV
